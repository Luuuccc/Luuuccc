## 💻 Projects

### Project 1

- Description: A Python implementation of the classic game Minesweeper. The project provides a function that takes a grid of mines and mine-free spots as input and returns a modified grid with the number of adjacent mines indicated. The goal of the game is to uncover all the mine-free spots without triggering any mines.

### Project 2

- Description: A simple calculator application that give the user the option to either enter two numbers and an operator (e.g. +, -, x, etc.) or to read all of the equations from a new txt file. Print out all of the equations together with the results. Every equation entered by the user would be written to a text file.
